> NOTE: the versions of the client have been altered to match the version of Private AI's deidentification it should be used with. This change will only reflect the first 2 points of the release (in this case 3.5) while the third point will indicate changes to the client.

## [1.3.3] - 2023-11-14

### Added
* Added reidentify_sensitive_labels attribute to the ReidentifyTextRequest object with the default set to True. If set to False, sensitive information (like credit card info) will not get reidentified in a reidentify request.
* Added best_labels to a processed text response object that returns an aggregation of all best_labels found in a process text operation.
* Added enable_non_max_suppression to the EntityDetection request object

### Changed
* ProcessText objects will no longer contain entity_detection or processed_text by default. To maintain the previous behaviour, they can be added explicitly (eg. req = process_text_obj(text=[], entity_detection=entity_detection_obj, processed_text=processed_text_obj))

### Fixed
* bug fix with the reidentify_text function where passing in a dictionary instead of a request object would call the wrong function

* Response objects that include processed text have 2 new functions: get_reidentify_entities() which returns a list of Entity objects containing entities used and their original text, and get_reidentify_request which will return a reidentify request object, ready to use with the reidentify endpoint.

### Changed
* Requests made with the client that return a  Non-200 response now raise an HTTP Error.
